# Welcome!
Hello! This is a repository that contains all assets for Route 88 Bike Cafe POS System in a subject called "Database Management System". This was made to show proof of contributions for each members involved from this project.

## Introduction / What is this?

## Table of Contents

> This README will be having Table of Contents due to possibly documenting a lot of components in this repository.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

## Prerequisites

> Here are the things that you need to install the software. Each software has labelled it's difficulty on how to use it.


### IDE Recommended
 > 1. Visual Studio Code (Dependent IDE) - For Coding w/o Compiling - Easy, w/ Compiling + Dependencies
 >2. IDE Options: Any IDE that involves that use of Python Library

### TOOLS & Visual Studio Code Dependencies
> 1. Beautify (Optional) for Code Beautification
> 2. Code Runner - Alternative Compiler for Visual Studio Code

### Collaboration
> 1. VS Live Share - If you need next level collaboration, you will need this one. Requires aspiring members because it will be hard to do it.
> 2. Github Desktop, Git GUI and Git Bash - Primary Collaboration Tool, Used by Current Project Leader
> 3. GitKraken, Git GUI and Git Bash, Advanced - Secondary Collaboration Tool
> 4. GitLens (Optional), Git GUI Integrated to Visual Studio Code GUI


## Deployment

Just run the your-compiled version of this program and that was it. No additional steps required. User cannot change things on database...

## Built With

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - A Scalable IDE with
Multiple Supported Essential Extension and Components for Easy Development and Integration.
* [Visual Studio Code Extension - Code Runner](https://github.com/formulahendry/vscode-code-runner) - A Visual Studio Code Extension used to build the program easily.
* [Python](https://python.org) - Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and integrate your systems more effectively.
## Contributing

This will be written soon.

## Versioning

We use don't use any APIs regarding software version. But instead we usually do based on time and date in 24H format. For example:
```
When Build is done: at 4:51 PM at 08/21/2018
Result Versioning is: 1651-082118.BETA
```
Beta is state of a program that is very unstable point.
We are planning to automatically do basic versioning with C Language soon. Not so complex but far more basic.
