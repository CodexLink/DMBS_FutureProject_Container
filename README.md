This will be written soon.

## Versioning

We use don't use any APIs regarding software version. But instead we usually do based on time and date in 24H format. For example:
```
When Build is done: at 4:51 PM at 08/21/2018
Result Versioning is: 1651-082118.BETA
```
Beta is state of a program that is very unstable point.
We are planning to automatically do basic versioning with C Language soon. Not so complex but far more basic.
